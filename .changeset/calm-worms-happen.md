Upgrade to latest config from webpack-dev-server v4.0.0-rc.0

The [release candidate](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/releases/tag/v4.0.0-rc.0) introduced some breaking changes which prevented the local server from running in new applications created with `create-single-spa`.

This also simplfies the configuration to take advantage of new default values.
