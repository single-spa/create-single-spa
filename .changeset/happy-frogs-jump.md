Upgrade to standalone-single-spa-webpack-plugin@3. For the majority of users, you can safely upgrade webpack-config-single-spa (-ts, -react, -react-ts) without any code changes.

See https://github.com/single-spa/standalone-single-spa-webpack-plugin/releases/tag/v3.0.0 for details about what was changed. It only impacts running projects in standalone mode.
