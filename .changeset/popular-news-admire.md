Breaking Changes

- NodeJS >= 12.13.0 now required, as we're using [style-loader@3](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/releases/tag/v3.0.0) in webpack-config-single-spa

Projects generated by single-spa

- New projects use Jest 27 (https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/05/25/jest-27#miscellaneous-breaking-changes), including jest-util and babel-jest
- Newly generated projects use React 17 types
- Newly generated projects now use concurrently 6. See https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently/releases/tag/v6.0.0
- Newly generated root configs and util modules now execute `git init` during creation
- Newly generated projects now use eslint-config-prettier 8. See https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#version-800-2021-02-21

Internal changes

- Upgrade yargs to 17 in create-single-spa, which parses the CLI args. See https://github.com/yargs/yargs/releases/tag/v17.0.0
- Upgrade yeoman-environment to v3 and yeoman-generator to v5. This comes with changes to how packages are installed by yeoman, but those changes don't apply to create-single-spa because only committed package.jsons result in yeoman-environment installs. Manually installing dependencies the old way via yeoman-generator.

Maintenance

- Upgrade to jest 27 (https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/05/25/jest-27#miscellaneous-breaking-changes), including jest-util and babel-jest
- Upgrade create-single-spa to husky 6. Upgrade newly generated projects to use husky 6
- Add `scripts/update-dependencies.sh` script for maintainers to easily upgrade all dependencies at once
