### Major Changes

- [#315](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/pull/315) [`729c6b1`](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/commit/729c6b1b537457fe8ec801b40c86c9eb7fb0fa84) Thanks [@joeldenning](https://github.com/joeldenning)! - Upgrade to standalone-single-spa-webpack-plugin@3. For the majority of users, you can safely upgrade webpack-config-single-spa (-ts, -react, -react-ts) without any code changes.

  See https://github.com/single-spa/standalone-single-spa-webpack-plugin/releases/tag/v3.0.0 for details about what was changed. It only impacts running projects in standalone mode.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#310](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/pull/310) [`5dc82a6`](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/commit/5dc82a6ce97a72a53dc2533fe45d2f02504be4e9) Thanks [@alexristich](https://github.com/alexristich)! - Upgrade to latest config from webpack-dev-server v4.0.0-rc.0

  The [release candidate](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/releases/tag/v4.0.0-rc.0) introduced some breaking changes which prevented the local server from running in new applications created with `create-single-spa`.

  This also simplfies the configuration to take advantage of new default values.

To upgrade, run one of the following commands:

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server@^4.0.0-rc.0

pnpm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server@^4.0.0-rc.0

yarn add --dev webpack-dev-server@^4.0.0-rc.0
```

### Major Changes

- [#300](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/pull/300) [`0ca13bb`](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/commit/0ca13bb8de64b2329bae04f7bf92b1e9fcb5c47a) Thanks [@joeldenning](https://github.com/joeldenning)! - Breaking Changes

  - NodeJS >= 12.13.0 now required, as we're using [style-loader@3](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/releases/tag/v3.0.0) in webpack-config-single-spa

  Projects generated by single-spa

  - New projects use Jest 27 (https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/05/25/jest-27#miscellaneous-breaking-changes), including jest-util and babel-jest
  - Newly generated projects use React 17 types
  - Newly generated projects now use concurrently 6. See https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently/releases/tag/v6.0.0
  - Newly generated root configs and util modules now execute `git init` during creation
  - Newly generated projects now use eslint-config-prettier 8. See https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#version-800-2021-02-21

  Internal changes

  - Upgrade yargs to 17 in create-single-spa, which parses the CLI args. See https://github.com/yargs/yargs/releases/tag/v17.0.0
  - Upgrade yeoman-environment to v3 and yeoman-generator to v5. This comes with changes to how packages are installed by yeoman, but those changes don't apply to create-single-spa because only committed package.jsons result in yeoman-environment installs. Manually installing dependencies the old way via yeoman-generator.

  Maintenance

  - Upgrade to jest 27 (https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/05/25/jest-27#miscellaneous-breaking-changes), including jest-util and babel-jest
  - Upgrade create-single-spa to husky 6. Upgrade newly generated projects to use husky 6
  - Add `scripts/update-dependencies.sh` script for maintainers to easily upgrade all dependencies at once
