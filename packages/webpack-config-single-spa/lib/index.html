<h2>How do I develop this microfrontend?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Copy the URL to your microfrontend entrypoint from
    <a href="/webpack-dev-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      >webpack-dev-server assets</a
    >
    to your clipboard
  </li>
  <li>
    In a new browser tab, go to the your single-spa web app. This is where your
    "root config" is running. You do not have to run the root config locally if
    it is already running on a deployed environment - go to the deployed
    environment directly.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the browser console, run
    <code>localStorage.setItem('devtools', true);</code> Refresh the page.
  </li>
  <li>
    A yellowish rectangle should appear at the bottom right of your screen.
    Click on it. Find the name @emoney/home and click on it. If it is not
    present, click on Add New Module.
  </li>
  <li>Paste the URL above into the input that appears. Refresh the page.</li>
  <li>Congrats, your local code is now being used!</li>
