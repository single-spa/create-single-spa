  # Migrating

  The create-single-spa api for generating new typescript projects did not change. However, to upgrade existing projects, do the following:

  1. Update your package.json. Make sure to replace `<%= packageManager %>` with either `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`

  ```diff
  {
    "scripts": {
  -     "build": "webpack --mode=production",
  +     "build": "concurrently <%= packageManager %>:build:*",
  +     "build:webpack": "webpack --mode=production",
  +     "build:types": "tsc"
    }
  }
  ```

  2. Update your tsconfig.json. Make sure to replace `<%= mainFile %>` with the proper value. This is in the format `org-project.ts`. React projects should have the `.tsx` file extension

  ```diff
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
  +     "declarationDir": "dist"
    },
  +   "files": ["src/<%= mainFile %>"]
  -   "include": ["src/**/*", "node_modules/@types"],
  +   "include": ["src/**/*"]
  }
  ```

  3. Add the `"types"` property to your package.json:

  ```diff
  {
  +  "types": "dist/<%= mainFile %>.d.ts"
  }
  ```

  4. Upgrade `ts-config-single-spa` to the latest 3.x release, which has new configuration for emitting types.

  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev ts-config-single-spa@^3.0.0

  pnpm install --save-dev ts-config-single-spa@^3.0.0

  yarn add --dev ts-config-single-spa@^3.0.0
  ```

  5. Now run `npm run build` or `npm run build:types` and verify that a typescript declaration file is outputted to your `dist` directory. Verify that the output file name is the same as the `"types"` property in your package.json.

  Require new --framework option when creating utility microfrontends. This is a breaking change for CLI users who rely on non-interactivity when running create-single-spa, as there's a new option required when `--moduleType util-module` is set. For most cases, though (e.g. when a human can respond to CLI prompts), this change is not a breaking behavior.

  Features:

  React utility microfrontends are now supported. When you create a new utility microfrontend, it will now ask for which framework you want the framework to be authored in. See https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/issues/264

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#300](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/pull/300) [`0ca13bb`](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/commit/0ca13bb8de64b2329bae04f7bf92b1e9fcb5c47a) Thanks [@joeldenning](https://github.com/joeldenning)! - Breaking Changes

  - NodeJS >= 12.13.0 now required, as we're using [style-loader@3](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/releases/tag/v3.0.0) in webpack-config-single-spa

  Projects generated by single-spa

  - New projects use Jest 27 (https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/05/25/jest-27#miscellaneous-breaking-changes), including jest-util and babel-jest
  - Newly generated projects use React 17 types
  - Newly generated projects now use concurrently 6. See https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently/releases/tag/v6.0.0
  - Newly generated root configs and util modules now execute `git init` during creation
  - Newly generated projects now use eslint-config-prettier 8. See https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#version-800-2021-02-21

  Internal changes

  - Upgrade yargs to 17 in create-single-spa, which parses the CLI args. See https://github.com/yargs/yargs/releases/tag/v17.0.0
  - Upgrade yeoman-environment to v3 and yeoman-generator to v5. This comes with changes to how packages are installed by yeoman, but those changes don't apply to create-single-spa because only committed package.jsons result in yeoman-environment installs. Manually installing dependencies the old way via yeoman-generator.

  Maintenance

  - Upgrade to jest 27 (https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/05/25/jest-27#miscellaneous-breaking-changes), including jest-util and babel-jest
  - Upgrade create-single-spa to husky 6. Upgrade newly generated projects to use husky 6
  - Add `scripts/update-dependencies.sh` script for maintainers to easily upgrade all dependencies at once
